This is my first time doing a project and I got 9 mark.  I've finished it for 3 weeks of continuous work.  Due to inexperience, I destroyed it and rebuilt it twice.  After that, I don't rush to work, instead I write out what stuffs I will do on paper and how to implement them.  This helps me avoid risks when working.About it, it's built using DevC with graphic.h library. This software simulates how a computer graphics program works. Through this, students understand how computer graphics and computer vision programs work. It is very useful for those of student who are majoring in **AI and Machine Learning**. For example like this following in advance:

Key knowledges include:  
- Computers perceives that a complex shape made up of basic shapes
- Showing the graphic shape with pixels, each pixel has a specified x y coordinate
- The basic computer geometry algorithms such as : rotation, scale, translation, projection, symmetry
- Computers draw a line using **algorithms**
- use matrix to represent 2D shape to 3D
