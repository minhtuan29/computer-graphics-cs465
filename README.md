Hello everyone, today I would like to introduce my first subject project. I built it using DevC with graphic.h library. This software simulates how a computer graphics program works. Through this, students understand how computer graphics and computer vision programs work. It is very useful for those of you who are majoring in AI and ML. Key knowledges include:  
- Computers perceives that a complex shape made up of basic shapes
- Showing the graphic shape with pixels, each pixel has a specified x y coordinate
- The basic computer geometry algorithms such as rotation, translation, projection, symmetry, scale
- Computers draw a line using algorithms


## How did I get 9 mark ?  
Necessary conditions:    
+ I do all the features requested by the teacher
+ Studying the lesson carefully, I was able to answer teacher's questions about the algorithm in the project  

Advantages for me to get high mark :  
+ I do not hardcode, when the teacher has a sudden request to change the input parameters, my program still do good (to be honest, I kinda lazy, it's have some hardcode. Lucky to me ^ ^ )
+ High performance of my program, no lag
+ Not only did I choose to write in C++, but I also used a tool with little support, but I built a good program.
+ Having code in OOP style, understand how OOP code is. In addition, I apply inheritance and abstraction 
   
To understand how OOP code, it take along time doing many projects to achieve. It is not possible to finish learning the class keyword and then code in OOP style. In the first two school years, we didn't do any software or project, we only solved some exercises such as on leetcode and student management. However, the first time I did a subject project, I can code OOP style. Because I used to make my own software and project before, so the teacher very like it

My project is simply, few features. I thought I barely passed the subject, but my teacher gave me a good compliment. Beautiful, simple, easy to see and easy to use. The lesson I learned is that we just need to do it simply and fully to get nice score ^ ^ .

If you see the article useful, give me a star to motivate me keep going <3
