Today I would like to introduce my first subject project. I built it using DevC with graphic.h library. This software simulates how a computer graphics program works. Through this, students understand how computer graphics and computer vision programs work. It is very useful for those of student who are majoring in **AI and Machine Learning**. For example like this following in advance:

Key knowledges include:  
- Computers perceives that a complex shape made up of basic shapes
- Showing the graphic shape with pixels, each pixel has a specified x y coordinate
- The basic computer geometry algorithms such as rotation, translation, projection, symmetry, scale
- Computers draw a line using **algorithms**
